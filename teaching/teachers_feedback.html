                2025 ——Will Thew</h2>
            <p>Yifan completed his teaching placement at Burnside High School under the supervision of Associate Teacher
                William Thew,
                teaching Year 10 and 11 students in Electronics (Digital Technologies).
                This placement provided opportunities for Yifan to apply pedagogical knowledge, build relationships with
                students,
                and demonstrate his growing professionalism. Yifan showed a strong willingness to engage with new
                content and teaching strategies,
                especially in a technically specialised subject area. He approached unfamiliar material with a proactive
                and open mindset,
                regularly seeking clarification and support to ensure he was well-prepared for teaching.
                His commitment to developing both his content knowledge and pedagogical approaches was evident in his
                planning,
                lesson delivery, and reflective discussions.</p>

                2025 ——Steve Dunford</h2>
            <p>Yifan has done a fantastic job of working with my students to understand their current knowledge and, in
                the case of my seniors, their projects. He has worked constantly to create learning experiences that
                dovetail nicely with what they are doing, and to push them to learn more about their subject, and also
                the tools they use.<br>

                He has worked equally well in both Electronics (junior) and Software Engineering (senior) - and was
                constantly asking if he could take classes, and preparing engaging lessons and simple and fun formative
                assessment material for each one.<br>

                Yifan has been an absolute pleasure to have in my classroom, and I believe he will become a fine
                teacher, and will only get better with time and experience.</p>

            <p>Hi,
                Mr. Wang took the class.
                I thought he was very competent. Nice relaxed style. Early classroom management.
                The class were engaged.</p>

            <p>Steve, a lovely enthusiastic class and Yifan is great.
                I had a fab day with your classes.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve, the class were attentive when Yifan took the class explaining the assignment.^.^
                They worked well with just a couple needing to be to keep on task.</p>

            <p>Mr Wang is a dedicated teacher.
                It is obvious he prepares well for every lesson and regularly checks on students individually to ensure
                all his students are accounted for.
                I have greatly enjoyed Mr Wang’s teaching and I wish him the best for his future.</p>

            <p>I think that Mr Wang has a very good teaching style that is easy to follow.
                It is obvious that he understands what he is teaching and that he cares about the topic.
                I have enjoyed his teaching and hope he does well in the future.</p>

            <p>Mr. Wang is a really enthusiastic teacher who taught me a lot.
                His lessons were always well-prepared and detailed, which allowed us to learn niche topics and pick up
                specific tips that we otherwise might have missed.
                The systematic approach of his teaching also made learning incredibly effective, and always had perfect
                flow and structure,
                you could tell every detail was carefully planned, One small improvement could be giving students a bit
                more time to work through problems independently before explaining the solution,
                although it is absolutely understandable as we do have a tight schedule and a large class. Overall I
                feel very lucky to be in the class and be a part of the learning.
                Thank you very much Mr Wang and wish you all the best-</p>
